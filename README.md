# VisualizeSort

VisualizeSort is a sorting algorithms visualizer built to help understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. With this tool, you can visually see how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performances on different datasets.



## Features

- Visualize various sorting algorithms in action.
- Compare the performance of different sorting algorithms.
- Customize array size and speed of visualization.
- Step through the sorting process or let it run automatically.
